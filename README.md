Human Interface Guidelines for HCA's ITS Mobile Lab (HITLAB)

## Overview

HCA's Mobile Lab in collaboration with the Integrations team developed a series of Human Interface Guidelines for both Web and Mobile platforms. The goal is to help enable design and development teams to create software that makes the best use of design and development practices and unifies the language the organization speaks for all internal projects.
